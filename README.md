# THERE IS A ISSUE WITH MODEL-2! PLEASE READ [fix](https://github.com/coltenthefirst/image-to-roblox/issues/5) TO FIX IT!

## Introduction

This repository contains the backend source code for the **Image To Parts** Roblox Game. This tool allows users to convert image URLs into parts within Roblox. Users are free to use the files provided in this repository for their own purposes.

## How It Works
Here’s a overview of the process:
1. Input an image URL and select a quality setting (such as mid, high, low, extra low).
2. The image URL and selected quality are sent to **Vercel**.
3. Vercel downloads the image and runs a Python script based on your selection.
4. A Lua script is generated and sent back to Roblox, where it is processed into parts that resemble the pixels of your image.

## Uploading Custom Images
For obtaining direct image urls, I recommended to use [Postimages.org](https://postimages.org/) to obtain a direct link. Other services can be used as long as they provide a direct link.

## FAQ

**Q: Does this have a NSFW filter?**  
**A:** This version does NOT have a nsfw filter. If you want a filter use: [Image To Roblox Parts Filtered](https://github.com/coltenthefirst/image-to-roblox-FILTERED)

**Q: Do my uploaded images get logged?**  
**A:** Uploaded images are temporary logged, they cannot be downloaded, viewed, or anything, unless its in Roblox.

**Q: Will I get banned for using exploit images?**  
**A:** I said before that you won't be banned, but you can be banned. Please be careful when using this in your games.
